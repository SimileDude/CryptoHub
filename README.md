## About Me
Hi there, I’m Ash, a passionate software developer with a love of coding as well as UI/UX design.  

Aside from some freelance work, I’m currently seeking a full-time role.  Do contact me if you’d like to chat: ashkherad@gmail.com.

## Summary
CryptoHub is a cryptocurrency web app that allows you to fetch coin data, search coins, chart trading data, create a watchlist, and perform (simple) trades.  

## Tools
I wrote all the code for this crypto web app. Some notable tools are:

-	Material UI (v5.8.7) as a UI framework
-	CoinGecko API to fetch crypto data
-	Chart.js (v3.9.1) API for the chart feature
